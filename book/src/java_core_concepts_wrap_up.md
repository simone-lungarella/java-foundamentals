# Java Core Concepts Wrap-up

This section covered the fundamental building blocks of the Java programming language. You learned about:

*   **Variables:** How to declare and initialize variables of different data types.
*   **Control Flow:** How to use `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, and `while` to control the flow of your program.
*   **Methods:** How to define and call methods to organize your code.
*   **Classes and Objects:** The basics of object-oriented programming in Java.
*   **Enums:** How to use enums to define a set of constants.

## Exercise

Write a simple Java program that simulates a basic calculator. The program should be able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Requirements:**

1.  Create a `Calculator` class.
2.  The `Calculator` class should have methods for `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide`.
3.  Create a `Main` class with a `main` method to test your `Calculator`.
4.  In the `main` method, create an instance of the `Calculator` class and call its methods with some sample numbers.
5.  Print the results of the calculations to the console.
6.  Use a `switch` statement to select the operation to perform based on a variable.
