# Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

This section will introduce you to the core principles of OOP in Java. We will cover:

- **Classes and Objects**: The fundamental building blocks of OOP.
- **Inheritance**: How to create new classes from existing ones.
- **Interfaces**: How to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of how to structure your Java programs in an object-oriented way.
