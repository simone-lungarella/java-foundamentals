# Advanced Java Wrap-up

This section covered some of the more advanced topics in Java. You learned about:

*   **Exceptions:** How to handle errors and exceptional situations in your code.
*   **Collections:** How to use the Java Collections Framework to store and manipulate groups of objects.
*   **Streams:** How to use the Streams API to process collections of data in a declarative way.
*   **Generics:** How to write type-safe code that works with different types of objects.
*   **File I/O:** How to read from and write to files.
*   **Threads:** How to write multithreaded programs that can perform multiple tasks concurrently.

## Exercise

Write a Java program that reads a list of words from a file, counts the frequency of each word, and then writes the results to a new file.

**Requirements:**

1.  Create a text file named `words.txt` with a list of words, one word per line.
2.  Write a program that reads the words from `words.txt`.
3.  Use a `Map` to store the frequency of each word.
4.  Use the Streams API to process the list of words.
5.  Write the word frequencies to a new file named `word_frequencies.txt`.
6.  Handle any potential `IOException`s that may occur.
